  # This script downloads and installs the release of starship

  # 1. Install latest version
  # if starship is already installed it will be updated to the latest version
  curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes --bin-dir ${INSTALL_DIR}

  # 2. Add starship to the system's PATH
  #
  cat <<EOF > ~/.bashrc.d/starship
# starship
export PATH=$INSTALL_DIR:\$PATH
eval "\$(starship init bash)"
EOF
  _logInfo "  âœ… starship installed successfully to $INSTALL_DIR"
